Remember old game Galaxian from some consoles, like Dendi? I remade it using C++ and library SFML 2.6.2
I was practising to code, so there are some extra files with my works and I used additional library sqlite3 to learn how to use SQL
In game you can:
- Start game or go to settings
- In settings you can change volume(master/sound/music)
- In game you can move left or right(using arrows or A/D), shoot using Z/X and pause(ESC)

Game stores your best score and also all scores you have had in the SQL database
My first code(galaxian.cpp) is so complicated, so I started new(galaxianmulti.cpp) to learn more about classes and functions, add multiplayer and to make my code more readable, but I didn't finish this one yet
